## CI Workflows for updating environment images

This repository is monitored by a series of CI testing jobs in GitHub Actions.

Each above docker repository folder has a set of CI jobs for:
- Passive update: `<docker_name>_Passive_Update.yml`
- PR checks: `<docker_name>_CheckPR.yml`
- Post merge update: `<docker_name>_PostMerge_Update.yml`


#### Updating existing environments

Create a Pull-Request to update the Dockerfile. GitHub Actions will automatically run on you Pull-Request and update the image when your Pull-Request is merged.

#### Adding a new environment image to an existing docker repository

Create a Pull-Request which contains a new Dockerfile in a new folder. The name of folder will be used as tag to the Dockerfile. Also related GitHub Actions workflows will need to be updated to cover your new tag.

#### Creating a new docker repository

Create a Pull-Request which contains a top level-folder as the name of the repository and a second-level folder as names of the tags. Dockerfiles need to be inside the tags folder. New GitHub Actions workflows for `Passive update`, `PR checks` and `Post merge update` to check the Dockerfiles need to be created by the owners.
